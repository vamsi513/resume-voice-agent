"""Call -> thread mapping, per-call serialisation, and duplicate-turn handling.

What this is: a correctness guard around the checkpointer, plus bookkeeping.
What this is not: authentication. A `call_id` says "these turns belong to one phone
call". It says nothing about who is on the line. Anyone who can reach the endpoint can
present any call id, so nothing here is treated as proof of identity -- and the agent
only ever reads from one public resume, so there is nothing per-caller to protect.

Three jobs:

1. Thread mapping. One Vapi call id -> one LangGraph thread id. Turns in a call reuse
   the thread (so the agent remembers "that project"); separate calls get separate
   threads and cannot see each other's history.

2. Serialisation. Vapi can have a request in flight when the caller interrupts and a
   new turn starts. Two concurrent runs on one thread would read the same checkpoint and
   write back conflicting versions -- last writer wins and a turn silently vanishes. An
   asyncio lock per call id makes turns on one thread strictly sequential. Different
   calls still run fully in parallel.

3. Duplicate turns. A retried or replayed request would otherwise append the same turn
   twice. Each turn is fingerprinted; a repeat inside the dedupe window replays the
   stored answer instead of re-running the graph.

This registry is in-process. One worker only -- see README "Scaling" for what moves
where if that stops being true.
