"""Retrieval over the resume: dense cosine, optionally fused with BM25.

Brute-force numpy over 10 chunks. An approximate index (FAISS, Qdrant) would add a
dependency and a failure mode to speed up a 10x1536 dot product that takes
microseconds -- so it isn't here. The interface is the one a vector DB would sit
behind if the corpus grew.

Two scores travel with every result and they do different jobs:
  dense_score -- raw cosine. Calibrated and comparable across queries, so this is
                 what the out-of-scope similarity gate reads.
  score       -- the ranking score (fused when hybrid is on). Good for ordering,
                 NOT calibrated, so it is never compared to a threshold.
